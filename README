This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3047

Re-written using the Self.vim Object prototype system, hence
justifying a major version number increase
(see: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3072).
The self.vim code is embedded in the scalacommenter.vim code
so you don't need to download self.vim.

Inspired by Kalle Bjorklid's JCommenter.
Works on Vim version 7.0 and above

This has two capabilities: 
  1) Generating a comment template, and
  2) Formatting an existing set of comment tags.

Generating ScalaDoc comments for Scala sources.
This is triggered by executing the ScalaCommentWriter() function
  1) while the cursor is over something meaningful, or
  2) if a (visual) selection exists,
The selected text is parsed and the comment template generated.

The following comments are generated (in the appropriate situations):

1. File comments: user specifies the template, generated when the
    cursor is on the first line of the file.
2. Class comments: generated when on top of a class declaration
    Tags if applicable: @author, @version, @since, @param, @tparam and @throws
3. Trait comments: generated when on top of a trait declaration
    Tags if applicable: @author, @version and @since
4. Object comments: generated when on top of a object declaration
    Tags if applicable: @author, @version and @since
5. Inner Class comments: generated when on top of an inner class declaration
    Tags if applicable: @param, @tparam and @throws
6. Inner Trait comments: generated when on top of an inner trait declaration
7. Inner Object comments: generated when on top of an inner object declaration
8. Method comments: generated when on top of a method declaration.
    Tags if applicable: @param, @tparam, @return and @throws
9. Fields, val and var, comments: generated when on top of a var or val
    declaration.

If executed and the class, trait, object or method already has a ScalaDoc
comment, an attempt is made to add/remove parameter and template parameter
tags as needed.

Formatting existing ScalaDoc comments for Scala sources.
This is triggered by executing the ScalaCommentFormatter() function
The user (visual) selection of the comment tag lines to be formatted
and invokes the ScalaCommentFormatter() function.
As an example, the following is selected and formatted:
   * @author    Tom  Jones
   * @version   1.3 03/10/50
   * @param  name This is the name
   * @param  value the value to associate with the value
   *  This is a second line. Here is a second second line.
   *    This is a third line. Here is a third third line.
   * @throws java.io.EOFException For no reason
   * @author Jane Doe
becomes:
   * @author  Tom Jones
   * @author  Jane Doe
   * @version 1.3 03/10/50
   * @param   name                         This is the name
   * @param   value                          the value to associate with the value This
   *                                                     is a second line. Here is a second second
   *                                                     line. This is a third line. Here is a third
   *                                                     third line.
   * @throws  java.io.EOFException For no reason

Note that tags are re-ordered and grouped based upon Sun's JavaDoc guide.
The start line selected to be formatted must be a comment tag line.
The end line selected to be formated should be a comment tag line
or a line containing additional text for a previous tag line.

Work flow:
  Generate comment template,
  Fill in template and then
  Format the comment's tags.
